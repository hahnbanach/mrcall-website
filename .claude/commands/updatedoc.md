description: Update project's basic documentation (Architecture + Docs headers)
---
1. Read the file `./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. You should take the content of this file always in "memory". Always refer to it!
2. List all markdown files (`*.md`) in the `docs/` directory.
3. For each file found in `docs/` (excluding ARCHITECTURE.md), read only the first 10 lines to extract the title/header using `head -n 10`.
4. Update `./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` with what we have done in this session. Remember that `./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` is not a log file: it must contain ONLY description of the architecture as is, WITH NO REFERENCE TO PAST IMPLEMENTATIONS! NO 'deprecated', 'legacy'. JUST AS IT IS.
5. Do the same for the relevant files in the `docs/` directory.
