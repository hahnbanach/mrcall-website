For small and medium businesses, the phone is still the primary way customers make contact. Whether it is a medical practice, a law firm, a restaurant, or a real estate agency — the phone rings, and someone needs to answer it.

## The Cost of Missed Calls

Every missed call has a cost. Research consistently shows:

- **62% of calls** to small businesses go unanswered
- **80% of callers** who reach voicemail never leave a message
- **85% of people** whose calls are not answered will not call back
- A single missed call can represent **hundreds or thousands of euros** in lost revenue

Hiring a full-time receptionist solves the problem but creates a new one: cost. A dedicated phone staff member costs EUR 25,000-35,000 per year in salary alone, plus benefits, training, and management overhead.

## The AI Alternative

AI telephone answering services offer a compelling middle ground: the professionalism and responsiveness of a dedicated receptionist at a fraction of the cost.

Modern AI phone agents can:

- Answer every call instantly, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week
- Conduct natural conversations in multiple languages
- Book appointments directly into your calendar
- Send the caller a follow-up message with confirmation details
- Provide you with a complete transcript and summary of every call
- Learn your business rules, FAQs, and preferences over time

## Real Business Impact

Businesses using AI telephone answering report measurable improvements:

- **Response rate**: From ~40% to 100% of calls answered
- **Booking conversion**: 20-30% increase in appointments booked
- **Staff productivity**: 5-10 hours per week freed from phone duty
- **Customer satisfaction**: Higher ratings due to instant, professional responses
- **After-hours revenue**: New leads captured outside business hours

## Getting Started

The barrier to entry is remarkably low. Most AI telephone answering services require no hardware, no phone system changes, and no technical expertise. You describe your business needs in plain language, and the AI agent is configured and ready to answer calls within minutes.

For SMBs looking to compete with larger organizations on customer service quality, AI telephone answering is not a luxury — it is becoming a necessity.
